# Vulnerability details

## Impact
In documentation protocol states that :
To compute the allocated contribution for a draw `d` we'd compute the integral of curve `c(d)=−t∗ln(α)∗α^d` from lastdraw d(old) to d(new), and which is equal to
`−t∗ α^d(old) + t∗ α^d(new)`. Which clearly shows that contribution only does not depend the interval of lastdraw to new draw while it also depends the current draw.

Now Coming to actual implementation , the implemented code does not depend on the current drawId, it only depends on the interval between new draw and completed draw.

if vaults are not producing high yields and new contributions are not good enough This calculation can break protocol and will consume reserve continuously as it will calculate balance based on the interval between draws[most probably high area region of contribution curve].

## Proof of Concept
we have 2 identical `accumulator` , `accumulator1 & accumulator2`. Both have no balance in starting.
Now suppose after different scenarios of contribution both accumulators have same available balance i.e after x1 draw in accumulator1 and x2 draw in accumulator2 both have same available  balance and now for next draw both accumulators have same interval gap [newdraw-lastcompletedDraw]

This is simple demonstration that shows claimed issue.
In General contribution is not dependent on draw it only depends on the interval between draw.
