# Vulnerability details

## Impact
`setDrawManager` offers Attacker to frontrun the tx which can lock `drawManager` role.
User will have to do costly redeployment which again prone to frontrun attack if he doesn't specify `drawManager` role in constructor and leads to DOS .

scenarios

1. if `drawManager` has not been set in constructor [**DOS**]
 this will lead to DOS as for every deployment Attacker can frontrun the `setDrawManager`. This will lock the
 `drawManager` role and so `prizePool`

2. As in constructor there is no address check for address so invalid address will cost redeployment

## Proof of Concept
see Impact

```solidity
File: src/PrizePool.sol

258 constructor(
  ConstructorParams memory params
)
  TieredLiquidityDistributor(
    params.numberOfTiers,
    params.tierShares,
    params.canaryShares,
    params.reserveShares
  )
{
  if (unwrap(params.smoothing) >= unwrap(UNIT)) {
    revert SmoothingGTEOne(unwrap(params.smoothing));
  }
  prizeToken = params.prizeToken;
  twabController = params.twabController;
  smoothing = params.smoothing;
  claimExpansionThreshold = params.claimExpansionThreshold;
  drawPeriodSeconds = params.drawPeriodSeconds;
  _lastClosedDrawStartedAt = params.firstDrawStartsAt;

  drawManager = params.drawManager;
  if (params.drawManager != address(0)) {
    emit DrawManagerSet(params.drawManager);
  }
282  }

299  function setDrawManager(address _drawManager) external {
  if (drawManager != address(0)) {
    revert DrawManagerAlreadySet();
  }
  drawManager = _drawManager;

306    emit DrawManagerSet(_drawManager);
}

## Tools Used

Manual

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

set the `drawManager` role to deployer(`msg.sender`) in constructor and then add a option to change `setdrawManager` where deployer can set `drawManager` to any address
