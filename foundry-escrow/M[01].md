## Title

deployement will fail for fee on transfer tokens

## Summary

As mentioned many times almost all type of tokens but for fee on transfer token deployement will fail everytime

## Vulnerability Details

in  `newEscrow` first `price` tokens sent to `computedAddress` then deployment occurs and for deployment `price` should not be less than balance of tokenContract.

In the case fee on transfer , transferred price will be less than param `price ` and hence the actual token balance of the tokenCOntract will be less than `price` resulting fail deployment
