## Summary

A Contest having high prize pool/funds will attract a lot of participant and higher participation will increase winner length [Also Malicious can use so many accounts to participate and gaining some percentage for every account] making `distribute` function out of gas and locking money in contract 

## Vulnerability Details
 
SEE SUMMARY

both described cases can increase winner's length. Which will make impossible to execute `distribute` function to work due to out of gas error.
Also I'm thinking to bigger picture as `Sparkn` pointed out they will be doing government funded projects so pretty sure there will be a lot of participation and chances of winner length very often
Severity- high
likelihood- high 
```solidity
File: src/Distributor.sol
function _distribute(address token, address[] memory winners, uint256[] memory percentages, bytes memory data)
        internal
    {
[...............]

        uint256 winnersLength = winners.length; // cache length
        for (uint256 i; i < winnersLength;) {
            uint256 amount = totalAmount * percentages[i] / BASIS_POINTS;
            erc20.safeTransfer(winners[i], amount);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

}
