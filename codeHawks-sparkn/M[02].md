## Summary
Admin creates new contest with `organizer`, `contestId`, `closeTime` and `implementation`. `implementation` is an contract address of distributor contract but can be passed as an `EOA` or address which don't have code, to create a contest 

## Vulnerability Details

As explained in Summary an `EOA` address can be passed as `implementation` address which will emit an `setContest`

```solidity
File:  src/ProxyFactory.sol

105  emit SetContest(organizer, contestId, closeTime, implementation);

```
https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-08-sparkn/blob/main/src/ProxyFactory.sol#L116

This event is an indicator to sponsors their interest of contest has been created and they will start investing by computing pre deployed address. 

But all the delegate call to this implementation address will fail and funds will be locked in contract.

This problem arises majorly when Deployer deploy contract using `CREATE2` opcode and doesn't do proper validation of contract deployed. So it will be best to do proper validation of implementation address
A eg Reference - https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-13-improper-validation-of-create2-return-value-code4rena-mochi-mochi-contest-git

```solidity
File: src/Proxy.sol

 fallback() external {
        address implementation = _implementation;
        assembly {
            let ptr := mload(0x40)
            calldatacopy(ptr, 0, calldatasize())
            let result := delegatecall(gas(), implementation, ptr, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
            let size := returndatasize()
            returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)

            switch result
            case 0 { revert(ptr, size) }
            default { return(ptr, size) }
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Impact is critical as loss of all the funds sent to proxyContract but likelihood is not high so marking as medium

## Tools Used

Manual

## Recommendations

check for `extcodesize(implementAddress)` during setting a contest and revert if it is zero.
