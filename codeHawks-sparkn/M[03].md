## Summary

Funds sent by sponsor after distributing rewards should be revoked. As currently owner can recover funds but a fixed `COMMISSION_FEE` [10% as of now] will go to `STADIUM_ADDRESS`.

## Vulnerability Details

Sponsor will loose 10% funds if he sent funds after distributing reward.

FLOW

Sponsor want to give rewards to winners but deadline has been passed and mistakenly he send tokens to proxyContract.
In this case only admin(Sparkn) can recover funds but some portion(COMMISSION_FEE) will be sent to `STADIUM_ADDRESS` and 
sponsor will get only 90% of his funds
```solidity
File: src/ProxyContract.sol

    function distributeByOwner(
        address proxy,
        address organizer,
        bytes32 contestId,
        address implementation,
        bytes calldata data
    ) public onlyOwner {
        if (proxy == address(0)) revert ProxyFactory__ProxyAddressCannotBeZero();
        bytes32 salt = _calculateSalt(organizer, contestId, implementation);
        if (saltToCloseTime[salt] == 0) revert ProxyFactory__ContestIsNotRegistered();
        // distribute only when it exists and expired
        if (saltToCloseTime[salt] + EXPIRATION_TIME > block.timestamp) revert ProxyFactory__ContestIsNotExpired();
        _distribute(proxy, data);
    }
```
Admin will recover funds by this method but only 90%[since commision_fee is 10% currently]
