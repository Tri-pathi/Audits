## Summary

All the contest transfer `COMMISSION_FEE` to a fixed immutable `STADIUM_ADDRESS` and if `STADIUM_ADDRESS` is blocked by parent token [USDC or any other token that implement a blacklist like functionality] all the funds will be locked in contract as `distribute` will revert and no way to get funds back.

## Vulnerability Details

Protocol heavily dependent on immutable `STADIUM_ADDRESS` and for any type of transfer of funds from contest make sure that `COMMISSION_FEE` is transferred to `STADIUM_ADDRESS`.

As from the given introduction ,Sparkn got a project, admin create a contest with a trusted `organizer` and `Sponsors` will transfer funds into proxyContract for distribution of reward 


FLOW

Sparkn got a bunch of project to work within week{Assume 10}.
Admin creates contest for all of them with their best `organizer` and `Sponsors` started funding all the contest and participant actively working to get reward and complete the task/contest
`STADIUM_ADDRESS` is same in all the contract to get `COMMISSION_FEE` but now `STADIUM_ADDRESS` is blocked by parent token and no transfer can happen.
```solidity
File: src/Distributor.sol

   function _commissionTransfer(IERC20 token) internal {
        token.safeTransfer(STADIUM_ADDRESS, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
