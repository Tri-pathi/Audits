## Title

Did not Approve to zero first before changing the allowance

## Summary

A very famous attack vector is present in ERC20 during changing allowance. Here in DecentralizedStableCoin Allowance is not being set to zero first before changing allowance i.e burning, transferring from allowance

## Vulnerability Details

See Summary.
Due to this vulnerability `approve(spender,amount)` can be front run and user will be force to allow extra tokens to attacker

Some other ERC20 tokens like (USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value . In these type of tokens `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front running attack

```solidty
FIle: "src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol"

    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {
            address owner = _msgSender();
            _approve(owner, spender, amount);
            return true;
        }

## Impact

`burnFrom` is prone to front run attack and also
Attacker will force user to approve more tokens to him than user intend

## Tools Used

## Recommendations

Make sure that Allowance is zero during changing the Allowance
