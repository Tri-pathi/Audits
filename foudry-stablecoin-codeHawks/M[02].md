## Title

`latestRoundData()` has no check for round completeness

## Summary

No check for RoundCompleteness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price.

## Vulnerability Details

The oracle wrapper `staleCheckLatestRoundData(priceFeed)` call out chainlink oracle with latestRoundData() to get the price of some token. Although the returned timestamp is checked that it's within the `TIMEOUT`,but there is no check for round completeness.

## Impact

If there is a problem with chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).

This could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price
