## Title

In `getTokenAmountFromUsd`, `price` is treated as in 8 decimals that will force to return incorrect amount usd amount for given token leading to loss of funds

## Summary

It has been mentioned by Protocol members that they will be using any token as a collateral as long as token/usd pricefeed is available in chainlink pricefeed.

But at many places it is hardcoded that token/usd pricefeed always return price in 8 decimals.
There are many tokens that don't return price in 8 decimals on different chains
e.g On Mainnet - LDO / USD
Avalanche - AAPL / USD , AMZN / USD,Calculated SAVAX / USD, GOOGL / USD NFLX / USD, TSLA / USD
Arbitrum - PEPE / USD
Optimism - PEPE / USD

for these tokens pricefeed would not return price in 8 decimals causing incorrect values

```solidity

File: src/DSCEngine.sol

function getTokenAmountFromUsd(address token, uint256 usdAmountInWei) public view returns (uint256) {
        // price of ETH (token)
        // $/ETH ETH ??
        // $2000 / ETH. $1000 = 0.5 ETH
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(s_priceFeeds[token]);
        (, int256 price,,,) = priceFeed.staleCheckLatestRoundData();
        // ($10e18 * 1e18) / ($2000e8 * 1e10)
        return (usdAmountInWei * PRECISION) / (uint256(price) * ADDITIONAL_FEED_PRECISION);
    }

    function getUsdValue(address token, uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(s_priceFeeds[token]);
        (, int256 price,,,) = priceFeed.staleCheckLatestRoundData();
        // 1 ETH = $1000
        // The returned value from CL will be 1000 * 1e8
        return ((uint256(price) * ADDITIONAL_FEED_PRECISION) * amount) / PRECISION;
    }

## Impact

most of the time `getTokenAmountFromUsd` will return zero as these will returns price in 18 decimals making denominatore of the order of (10**18) \* (10**10)= 10\*\*28 and `getUsdValue` will return more than expected usd value

## Tools Used

Manual Review

## Recommendations

1. One solution can be only allow tokens which returns price in 8 decimal

but as it intented to use for most of the tokens

2. Rathar than using hardcoded 8 decimals use returns price and scale into 18 decimal
