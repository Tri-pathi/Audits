# Vulnerability details

## Impact
`_deploy` function does not do proper validation of create2 return value if there is revert from create2 opcode or in case of failed contract deployment.
It should check bytecode of return address but it doesn't.
`create2` opcode returns the expected address which will never be the zero address but it's bytecode can be zero

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

check for `extcodesize(deployedAddress_ )` and revert if it is zero.
