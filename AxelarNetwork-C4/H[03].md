# Vulnerability details

## Summary
After approving the call `AxelarGateway.sol` emits an event [such as `ContractCallApproved`] which includes `commandId,sourceChain,contractAddress,payloadHash, sourceTxHash, sourceTxHash, sourceEventIndex`. for executing `execute` Axelar powered apps will need `payloadHash` but in the event emission it's `payload`. so for executing execute, destination contract address will have to find payload from `ContractCall` by matching payload and payloadHash. which will be very expansive and i don't think protocol is designed to use in this way
## Impact
finding `payload` for executing `execute` for Aexlar Powered Apps will be very expansive and Axelar powered apps will have to make unnecessary storage system to store a mapping of payload vs payloadHash and then he can make call.
it can be very expansive for destination contract address which have high inflow tx

## Proof of Concept
```solidity
File : contracts/gmp-sdk/executable/AxelarExecutable.sol
   function execute(
       bytes32 commandId,
       string calldata sourceChain,
       string calldata sourceAddress,
       bytes calldata payload
   ) external {
       bytes32 payloadHash = keccak256(payload);

       if (!gateway.validateContractCall(commandId, sourceChain, sourceAddress, payloadHash)) revert NotApprovedByGateway();

       _execute(sourceChain, sourceAddress, payload);
   }
```
```solidity
File: contracts/cgp/AxelarGateway.sol
function approveContractCall(bytes calldata params, bytes32 commandId) external onlySelf {
       (
           string memory sourceChain,
           string memory sourceAddress,
           address contractAddress,
           bytes32 payloadHash,
           bytes32 sourceTxHash,
           uint256 sourceEventIndex
       ) = abi.decode(params, (string, string, address, bytes32, bytes32, uint256));

       _setContractCallApproved(commandId, sourceChain, sourceAddress, contractAddress, payloadHash);
       emit ContractCallApproved(commandId, sourceChain, sourceAddress, contractAddress, payloadHash, sourceTxHash, sourceEventIndex);
   }
```
According to implementation Axelar powered operate on this event and execute function when contractAddress matches but then they have to use `payload` instead of `payloadHash`.

## Tools Used
Manual

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
There is 2 way this can be mitigated
1. in `AxelarGateway.sol` during contract call `payload` and `payloadHash` both have been emitted so in approvingContractCall `payload` can also be emitted which will solve the issue
2. `execute` function can take `payloadHash` as param to check if the call has been approved and then again he will need payload to use calldata and params. so i think 1 can solve problem and believe that this was the reason payload and payloadHash both were emitted during first call
