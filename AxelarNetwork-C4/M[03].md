# Vulnerability details

## Impact

`rotateSigners ` increases the `signerEpoch` by 1. Due to this there is no way to complete all the pending tx in previous epoch.
for a tx to complete that has to be in same epoch. As to complete a multisig tx a threshold number of signers will have to call function with same arguments, but here is no event emission once a tx initiate by signers or any kind of information that can help signers to know about which tx is pending [basically need signers approval to complete]
so we can assume that a lot of tx is in pending state at any point of unintentionally.
But as `rotateSigners ` is completed there is no way previous tx can be completed

## Proof of Concept

In POC i would like to mention 2 things
1. signers can call only current epoch tx
2. ` _rotateSigners ` increases epoch by 1 everytime

SO there is no point of contact with previous epoch's pending tx

## Tools Used
Manual
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
I'm not able to find a way from current logic. A good solution can be emit event when a signer initiate tx so that other signers can sign atleast intentional txs. this will allow only unintentional tx into pending state
