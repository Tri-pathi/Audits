# Vulnerability details

## Summary
Protocol claims that proposal hash is unique but it is not.
Any one can duplicate proposal hash and do harm the protocol causing cancelling and revoking of proposals
## Impact
see Summary

## Proof of Concept

```solidity
function _getProposalHash(
       address target,
       bytes memory callData,
       uint256 nativeValue
   ) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
       return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(target, callData, nativeValue));
   }
```
this function is used to compute proposal hash which can duplicate by attacker
## Tools Used
Testing
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
add msg.sender or nonce type of things to make proposal unique


## Assessed type
