# Vulnerability details

## Impact

`deployAndInit` is prone to front run attack. Attacker can front run using the same params[`bytecode and salt `] and caller tx will revert as contract is deployed already.
Implementation tried to update salt but it doesn't update to stop the front run attack

## Proof of Concept

Alice wants to deploy contract via `deployAndInit` so she initiated a tx by passing params `bytecode, salt and init`. malicious Bob see the tx in public mempool and using same bytecode and changing the salt to `newsalt` by encoding salt with alice address as he already new alice address and deployed the contract using `create2` opcode successfully.

Now Alice tx will revert due to redeployment.

In evm.codes for create2 opcode there is some listed reason due to deployment can fail.
`A contract already exists at the destination address` is one of them.



## Tools Used
Manual
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
this attack vector is due to salt as encoding with msg.sender doesn't help here.
A better way can be deploy and then init in different tx.[yet not sure]
