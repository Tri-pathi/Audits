# Vulnerability details

## Impact
To execute a multisig tx , threshold number of signers will have to call function with same arguments. I believe that logic of same argument is to verify that all the calling signers wants to do same thing so assume they don't share arguments and submit by their own will.

from the current implementation to call `hasSignerVoted`  and `getSignerVotesCount` we need to give `topic` which is only known to some signers may be. signers who has no information about `msg.data` can't see any information about current pending tx[multisig tx which need more signers to call to complete].
since only place `topic` is emitted after completing the tx.
