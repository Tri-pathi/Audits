# Vulnerability details

## Impact
`remove_gauge` is a method present in `GaugeController.sol` which can be called only by governance. This method is prone to frontrun attack and due to that majority user's will be able to dissolve their votes for specific gauge.

All the users will call `vote_for_gauge_weights` with `user_weight` param zero and hence they will be able to use their votes on other gauge but weight of users who won't able to front run this tx , will be stuck in the removed gauge and no way to get them back

## Proof of Concept
```solidity
function remove_gauge(address _gauge) external onlyGovernance {
       require(isValidGauge[_gauge], "Invalid gauge address");
       isValidGauge[_gauge] = false;
       _change_gauge_weight(_gauge, 0);
       emit GaugeRemoved(_gauge);
   }
```
this can be called by governance and which can be front run for the tx
```solidity
function vote_for_gauge_weights(address _gauge_addr, uint256 _user_weight) external {
    [....]
      power_used = power_used + new_slope.power - old_slope.power;
      require(power_used >= 0 && power_used <= 10_000, "Used too much power");

     [.....]
     }
```
some of all the weigh should not be more than 10000, hence they will front run initial tx to withdraw votes from the target gauge while other user's weight will be stuck here who won't able to front run the tx and their power used here will be stuck such that they won't able to retrieve it

SOrry i can't suggest any mitigation steps, yet need to dig more in the protocol to finally suggest a mitigation
