# Vulnerability details

## Impact

VotingEscrowâ€™s balanceOfAt and totalSupplyAt return their corresponding values for a
given block. Because the balance and supply can vary within the same block, these
functions can return different values when called on the current block.


## Proof of Concept
These both function use a binary search to return their values associated with the block
```solidity
function _findBlockEpoch(uint256 _block, uint256 _maxEpoch) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // Binary search
    uint256 min = 0;
    uint256 max = _maxEpoch;
    // Will be always enough for 128-bit numbers
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 128; i++) {
        if (min >= max) break;
        uint256 mid = (min + max + 1) / 2;
        if (pointHistory[mid].blk <= _block) {
            min = mid;
        } else {
            max = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return min;
}
```
if a block is contained in `pointHistory`, the latest one will be used.

Points on the current block can be added indefinitely in `pointHistory`. As a result , a user calling balanceOfAt or totalSupplyAt on the current block might not receive the latest value

## Exploit Scenario
Alice creates a voting contract that relies on `balanceOfAt` and `totalSupplyAt`. Alice creates a vote using block.number as a snapshot and corrupts the quorum percentage

## Tools Used

Manual

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

these both function should not be called at current block .
change `require(_blockNumber <= block.number, "Only past block number");` to `require(_blockNumber < block.number, "Only past block number"); `


## Assessed type
