# Vulnerability details

## Summary
The GaugeController voting can be abused to apply all of the user's weight in every gauge's vote.
GaugeController's voting changes the weight of the gauge. Each user can split their voting weight power between the gauges
```solidity
function vote_for_gauge_weights(address _gauge_addr, uint256 _user_weight) external {
       require(_user_weight >= 0 && _user_weight <= 10_000, "Invalid user weight");
       [............]
       require(slope_ >= 0, "Invalid slope");
       uint256 slope = uint256(uint128(slope_));
       [............]
       VotedSlope memory new_slope = VotedSlope({
           slope: (slope * _user_weight) / 10_000,
           end: lock_end,
           power: _user_weight
       });
       [............]
       //The sum of all the weight used must not exceed 10,000:
       uint256 power_used = vote_user_power[msg.sender];
       power_used = power_used + new_slope.power - old_slope.power;
       require(power_used >= 0 && power_used <= 10_000, "Used too much power");

   }



```
while A gauge's weight can be updated every week
```solidity
function _change_gauge_weight(address _gauge, uint256 _weight) internal {
       uint256 old_gauge_weight = _get_weight(_gauge);
       uint256 old_sum = _get_sum();
       uint256 next_time = ((block.timestamp + WEEK) / WEEK) * WEEK;

       points_weight[_gauge][next_time].bias = _weight;
       time_weight[_gauge] = next_time;

       uint256 new_sum = old_sum + _weight - old_gauge_weight;
       points_sum[next_time].bias = new_sum;
       time_sum = next_time;
   }

   /// @notice Allows governance to overwrite gauge weights
   /// @param _gauge Gauge address
   /// @param _weight New weight
   function change_gauge_weight(address _gauge, uint256 _weight) public onlyGovernance {
       _change_gauge_weight(_gauge, _weight);
   }

```
There is no lock to prevent a user from removing their weight after a vote. As a result , an Attacker can put 100% of its voting power on a gauge's vote, and remove it right afterwards to re-use all its voting power on another vote

## Impact

See summary
### Exploit Scenario

Alice has 1,000,000 tokens locked. Alice calls `vote_for_guage_weights` with a voting power of 10000(100%) and then all the user voted as seeing/understand the consequences of Alice votes on gauge and after sometime Alice withdraw his votes by calling voting power of 0.

Here Alice manipulating the weights updates more than she should

## Proof of Concept

see summary and impact

This issue arise from the original fork of Curve DAO [GaugeController.vy](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-dao-contracts/blob/master/contracts/GaugeController.vy). This issue was found by TOB team during audit and Curve team mitigated this by adding a line of code
```vyper
assert block.timestamp >= self.last_user_vote[msg.sender][_gauge_addr] + WEIGHT_VOTE_DELAY, "Cannot vote so often"
```
i.e disallowing changing votes more often than once in 10 days

## Tools Used
Manual Testing

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Mitigate this by disallowing changing weight votes more often than once in SOME FIXED TIME_PERIOD in the same way as Curce DAO
or design a different design for this issue
