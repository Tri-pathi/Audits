## Title

`LinkedList.insert` can damage the whole tick state

## Summary
`LinkedList.insert` can damage the whole tick state. Inserting `newValue`  between `lowervalue` to `nextValue` it also deletes all the Linkedlist node already present betweeen `lowerValue` and `nextValue`

## Vulnerability Detail

`insert` function insert `newValue` a LinkedList node between two sorted ListNode nodes but it doesn't check that other two nodes are consecutive or not. In case if `lowerValue` and `nextValue` are not consecutive `insert` function will delete all the nodes that are present between `lowerValue` and `nextValue`.

I current implementation it has been make sure that these two nodes are consecutive in `pool.sol` but in future such math helper function can do critical  damage to the protocol .


## Impact

will delete all the tick state between `lowerValue` to `nextValue`

## Code Snippet
```solidity

File: ks-elastic-sc/contracts/libraries/Linkedlist.sol
  function insert(
    mapping(int24 => Linkedlist.Data) storage self,
    int24 newValue,
    int24 lowerValue,
    int24 nextValue
  ) internal {
    require(nextValue != self[lowerValue].previous, 'lower value is not initialized');
    require(lowerValue < newValue && nextValue > newValue, 'invalid lower value');
    self[newValue].next = nextValue;
    self[newValue].previous = lowerValue;
    self[nextValue].previous = newValue;
    self[lowerValue].next = newValue;
  }
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 checking before calling this function is good step but adding this check will help protocol 
add this line
```soldity
    require(self[lowerValue].next== self[nextValue].previous, 'nodes are not consecutive'); // make sure they are consecutive 

```
