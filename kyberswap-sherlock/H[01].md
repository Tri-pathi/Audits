## Title
Unbound loop enables denial ofservice

## Summary
The swap function relies on an unbounded loop. An attacker could disrupt swap operations by forcing the loop to go through too many operations, potentially trapping the swap due to a lack of gas

## Vulnerability Detail

`Pool.swap` iterates over the tick. 
```solidity
File: ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol
371   while (swapData.specifiedAmount != 0 && swapData.sqrtP != limitSqrtP) {
    [...............]
      
      
[................]

464}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap-Tri-pathi/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L464
on every loop iteration , there us a swap on the current tick's price ,increasing or decreasing it to the next price limit. the next price limit depends on the next tick
```solidity

File: ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol
394        int256 usedAmount;
        int256 returnedAmount;
        uint256 deltaL;
397        (usedAmount, returnedAmount, deltaL, swapData.sqrtP) = SwapMath.computeSwapStep(
          swapData.baseL + swapData.reinvestL,
          swapData.sqrtP,
          targetSqrtP,
          swapFeeUnits,
          swapData.specifiedAmount,
          swapData.isExactInput,
          swapData.isToken0
 405       );

The next tick is the next node of current linkedList node  (or an uninitialized tick if no initialized tick is found).
A rough gas cost analysis estimate that depending upon the cases 3000 to 4000 iteration[from the number of times SLOAD,SSTORE has been used]

A Attacker could create thousands of positions with a minimum affordable value to make the system very costly and potentially prevent swap operations .
An Attacker would have to pay gas to create the position. However, an Ethereum miner could create a position without gas cost, and if the system is going to be deploy on L2, the attacker's gas payment would be significantly lower
As kyberswap is in competitive dex so likelihood is high. 

Uniswap mitigate this issue by introducing `tickspacing`

## Recommendation

Consider implementing something like tickspacing or consider setting a minimum liquidity per position
