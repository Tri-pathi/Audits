# About Me

Namaskar friends. I'm Tripathi, an engineering student who is building DeFi/Zk protocols and spending time on Solidity for bugs. I'm currently active in many competitive audit platforms like Code4rena, CodeHawks, Sherlock, Cantina Code, and Hats

## Connect Me


I am always looking for new opportunities, be it a job opening, private audit/security review, or simply for collaborations. Currently, I'm contributing to [AbsintheLabs](https://www.absinthelabs.xyz/) as a zk/Solidity dev part-time.
