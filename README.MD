# About Me

Namaskar friends. I'm Tripathi, an engineering student who is building DeFi/Zk protocols and spending time on Solidity for bugs. I'm currently active in many competitive audit platforms like Code4rena, CodeHawks, Sherlock, Cantina Code, and Hats

## Connect Me


I am always looking for new opportunities, be it a job opening, private audit/security review, or simply for collaborations.

# Summary

### Knoct (Jan 2023 - May 2023)

[Knoct](https://www.knoct.in/),the most secure identity wallet for all your applications, where I worked as a ZKP Researcher and Solidity developer. I implemented metatransactions, Diamond Proxy, and various contracts like Verifier and Holder, which play crucial roles in the overall architecture of anonymous-based credentials

### Secureum / CTFs / Audit reports (jun 2023 - Aug 2023)

I began learning security by solving CTFs like Ethernaut and Damn Vulnerable DeFi. Secureum significantly helped me understand basic Solidity and EVM concepts. During this period, I discovered public audit platforms like Code4rena, Sherlock, and Codehawks. I competed in several contests and earned my first $1000 from security in August.

### Competitive Programming /DSA / University Placement Prep (Sept 2023 - Nov 2023)

During this time, I solved over 300 high and medium-level LeetCode problems. With prior experience in data structures, I focused on Codeforces and became an expert b. I also started research on the Aluminium 7XXX series alloy to prevent the natural aging process, a significant issue causing substantial industry losses. I secured a job in the first week of December. Now, I have some free time and am helping students with their placement preparation

### Absinsthe Labs(Jan 2024 - Feb 2024)

I started feeling inclination towards smart contract security so jumped into public audits platforms. Explored more than 15 DeFi protocols in depth and began contributing to [Absinsthe Labs](https://x.com/absinthe_labs?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)(Building the next generation of points and incentive distribution for Web3) as Solidity developer. implemented the overall [zeekaptcha-core](https://github.com/AbsintheLabs/zeekaptcha-core) ,which is home for smart contract verifiers and circom zk circuits. I enjoyed working with circuits and zk-SNARKs logic, became familiar with Tornado Cash contracts, and implemented everything from scratch for learning purposes: - https://github.com/Tri-pathi/ZK-Snarks

### Influx-Exchange(March 2024 )

[Influx](https://docs.influx.exchange/) is a DeFi protocol that handles bad debt differently, allowing users to leverage even memecoins, which is not possible with traditional perpetual DEXs. I was part of the team part-time while doing audits in my other part-time role. I implemented a staking reward system, which was a modified fork of MasterChef. I transitioned to security full-time as they pivoted to Solana, since I lacked experience in Rust.

### Public/Private Audits (April 2024 - Now)

I graduated in May, and since then, I've been fully dedicated to security. I now participate in contests, conduct private audits, learn new things daily
